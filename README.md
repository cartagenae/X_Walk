> Useful if you have thousands of files stored in an Excel spreadsheet as records and if you need to rename them all using other column details

> NOTE: The files retain their original formats and extensions. For instance original.pdf is going to retain the same format and extension as newname.pdf. So will original.tif to newname.tif.
